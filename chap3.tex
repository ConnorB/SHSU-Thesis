\section{Ecosystem Metabolism}

Across all sites, median GPP ranged from 0.12 to 0.77 \unit{\goxy}, while median ER ranged -0.84 to -10.85 \unit{\goxy}. ER exceeded GPP across all sites, resulting in median NEP ranging from -0.35 to -10.41 \unit{\goxy} (Table \ref{tab:GPP-ER}). All sites were heterotrophic, i.e, where ER exceeds GPP, with very few (1-4) autotrophic days. Across all sites, day to day variability in GPP (CV 1.16 \%) was low whereas ER (CV -1.18 \%) exhibited slightly more daily variation than GPP (Figure~\ref{fig:GPPvER}). There was a subtle increase in GPP across the precipitation gradient, with the exception of GC where median GPP was low (0.25 \unit{\goxy}), falling in line with the most arid sites (Figure~\ref{fig:GPPBox}). 

Unlike GPP, there was no discernible pattern in ER (Figure~\ref{fig:ERBox}) nor in NEP (Figure~\ref{fig:NEPBox}) from semi-arid to mesic study sites. ER varies across the precipitation gradient, but ER at WMC  was 3-13 fold greater than the other sites (Table~\ref{Tab:GPPandER}). At PDC, I was only able to estimate metabolism for 279 days out of the nearly 2 years of data because the stream was completely dry or was disconnected pools during 2020-2021 (Table~\ref{Tab:GPPandER}).


Between SFC, AR, and PLC there appeared to be slight spring and summer increases in GPP and ER across the precipitation gradient in 2020, there is not the same pattern in 2017. GPP increased later into the summer as precipitation increased along the gradient (Figure~\ref{Fig:MetabStacked}).

Points above the 1:1 line indicate days of autotrophy where gross primary production (GPP) exceeds ecosystem respiration (ER), and points below are heterotrophic days were ER exceeds GPP. Across all sites, ER was more variable than GPP with very few autotrophic days (e.g. 2 days at WMC and 1 day at PLC and EMC).}

\section{DOC and Nutrients}

Across all sites, average DOC ranged from 5.3 to 12.5 \unit{\mg\per\L} (Figure~\ref{Fig:DOC}). Along the precipitation gradient from semi-arid SFC to semi-mesic GC, average DOC increased (from 6.4 to 9.3 \unit{\mg\per\L}); however, average DOC concentrations at EMC, where land use is predominantly agriculture, were 5.5 \unit{\mg\per\L}, and did not follow the pattern of increasing DOC concentrations along the precipitation gradient (Figure~\ref{Fig:DOC}). Similarly, DOC concentrations at TRC, the driest site with the most non-agricultural vegetation, was the highest along the gradient (12.5 \unit{\mg\per\L}) (Table \ref{tab: Nutrients}).

Unlike DOC concentrations, there were no discernible patterns in nutrients across the precipitation gradient. Two of the sites (SFC and AR) had high levels of NO$_3$-N and PO$_4$-P, 20-185x higher for NO$_3$-N and 10-35x higher for PO$_4$-P (Figure \ref{Fig:Nitrate}~and~\ref{Fig:SPR}). Both of these sites receive waste water treatment plant effluent.

\section{Discharge}

Across the precipitation and land use gradients, average discharged ranged from \qtyrange{.03}{3.00}{\cubic\m\per\second}, with WMC having the highest discharge, and PDC the flashiest (Table~\ref{tab:Q}). Across the gradients, discharge greatly varied between sites and had quick responses to storm events (Figure \ref{Fig:Q}).

\section{Principal Component Analysis and Structural Equation Model}

The PCA based on percentages of watershed land use categories identiﬁed two gradients in these sites. Land use-PC1, explaining 44.1\% of the variation, and was explained by wetlands, shrubs, and grasslands to cropland and developed land, while land use-PC2, explaining 29\% of the variation, ordered streams along a gradient of forest and pasture relative to other land uses  (Figure~\ref{Fig:PCA}). PC values were used as a proxy for watershed land use in the structural equation model to evaluate distal and proximal drivers of GPP and ER.

\label{Fig:PCA}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


I used a structural equation model to parse out the drivers of GPP and ER. I used the proximal drivers, average monthly precipitation, the presence of WWTP in the watershed, and land use PC1 and PC2 and distal drivers, discharge (CV), DOC, nitrate, and phosphate to explain the variability in monthly GPP and ER. I was unable to find a statistically significant model for the drivers of GPP and ER (Figure~\ref{Fig:SEMmetab}). However, when GPP and ER were removed from the model, there was a statistically significant model (Figure~\ref{Fig:SEMdrivers}). The results of the second SEM without GPP and ER indicated that land use PC1 and PC2 are strongly driving NO$_3$-N, PO$_4$-P, DOC, and turbidity, while monthly average precipitation is weakly driving NO$_3$-N and DOC.
