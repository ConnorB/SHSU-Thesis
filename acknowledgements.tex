\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

I would like to thank Dr. Amber Ulseth for everything she's done for me during my time at SHSU. Without her mentorship and endless support, I would not be the ecologist I am today and I am eternally grateful. I also want to thank my friend and mentor, Dr. Kelbi Delaune, for instilling her love of streams into me, her constant support, and encouragement to continue pursuing my education. I would also like to thank all the undergraduates who helped me in the field during my research. Finally, I would like to thank my friends, Chelsea Thorn, Brittany Cornell, and Dani Gray for constant encouragement and countless hours in the field. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1927639.
