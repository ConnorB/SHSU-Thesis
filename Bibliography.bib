	abstract = {In high-altitude alpine catchments, diurnal streamflow cycles are typically dominated by snowmelt or ice melt. Evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycles are less observed in these catchments but might happen simultaneously. During a field campaign in the summer 2012 in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20.4 km2, glaciarized area: 2\%), we observed a transition in the early season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycle in one of two monitored subbasins. The two different cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within a time span of several days. In the second monitored subbasin, we observed an ice meltdominated diurnal cycle during the entire season due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between ice melt and evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening at the same times of day but with a different sign and a different shape. The amplitude of the ice melt cycle decreased exponentially during the season and was larger than the amplitude of the evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the season. Our study suggests that an evapotranspirationdominated diurnal streamflow cycle could damp the ice melt-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle. The two types of diurnal streamflow cycles were separated using a method based on the identification of the active riparian area and measurement of evapotranspiration.},

We present a model that yields ecosystem-level predictions of the flux, storage and turnover of carbon in three important pools (autotrophs, decomposers, labile soil C) based on the constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate. 2. The model predicts a 10 000-fold increase in C turnover rates moving from tree- to phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems due to the size dependence of photosynthetic rates. 3. The model predicts a 16-fold increase in rates controlled by respiration (e.g. decomposition, turnover of labile soil C and microbial biomass) over the temperature range 0-30°C due to the temperature dependence of ATP synthesis in respiratory complexes. 4. The model predicts only a fourfold increase in rates controlled by photosynthesis (e.g. net primary production, litter fall, fine root turnover) over the temperature range 0-30°C due to the temperature dependence of Rubisco carboxylation in chloroplasts. 5. The difference between the temperature dependence of respiration and photosynthesis yields quantitative predictions for distinct phenomena that include acclimation of plant respiration, geographic gradients in labile C storage, and differences between the short- and long-term temperature dependence of whole-ecosystem CO 2 flux. 6. These four sets of model predictions were tested using global compilations of data on C flux, storage and turnover in ecosystems. 7. Results support the hypothesis that the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate impose important constraints on the global C cycle. The model thus provides a synthetic, mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular-, individual- and community-level processes. © 2005 British Ecological Society.},

A variety of physical data from lowland streams in western Washington displays the onset of readily observable aquatic-system degradation at a remarkably consistent level of development, typically about ten percent effective impervious area in a watershed. Even lower levels of urban development cause significant degradation in sensitive water bodies and a reduced, but less well quantified, level of function throughout the system as a whole. Unfortunately, established methods of mitigating the downstream impacts of urban development may have only limited effectiveness. Using continuous hydrologic modeling we have evaluated detention ponds designed by conventional event methodologies, and our findings demonstrate serious deficiencies in actual pond performance when compared to their design goals. Even with best efforts at mitigation, the sheer magnitude of development activities falling below a level of regulatory concern suggests that increased resource loss will invariably accompany development of a watershed. Without a better understanding of the critical processes that lead to degradation, some downstream aquatic-system damage is probably inevitable without limiting the extent of watershed development itself.},

Microalgae are important sources of organic matter in most aquatic systems, because they transform solar energy into reduced carbon compounds. It is clear that autochthonous DOM of algal and macrophyte origin is an important contributor to the total pool of organic matter in most aquatic environments. Production of DOM from aquatic algae and macrophytes occurs by several different mechanisms: predatory grazing, cell death and senescence, viral lysis, and extracellular release. Both algae and macrophytes release a significant proportion of their net primary production as dissolved organic matter during active growth. More in-depth assessment of the functional links between heterotrophic microorganisms and aquatic primary producers including: kinetic studies of DOM release, transformation and uptake, as well as population level coupling between primary producers and heterotrophic microorganisms, may help in understanding the influence of autochthonously produced DOM on aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {1. It is becoming increasingly clear that fresh waters play a major role in the global C cycle. Stream ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary productivity (GPP) exert a significant control on organic carbon fluxes in fluvial networks. However, little is known about how climate change will influence these fluxes. 2. Here, we used a 'natural experiment' to demonstrate the role of temperature and nutrient cycling in whole-system metabolism (ER, GPP and net ecosystem production - NEP), in naturally heated geothermal (5-25°C) Icelandic streams. 3. We calculated ER and GPP with a new, more accurate method, which enabled us to take into account the additional uncertainties owing to stream spatial heterogeneity in oxygen concentrations within a reach. ER ranged 1-25gCm-2day-1 and GPP 1-10gCm-2day-1. The median uncertainties (based on 1 SD) in ER and GPP were 50\% and 20\%, respectively. 4. Despite extremely low water nutrient concentrations, high metabolic rates in the warm streams were supported by fast cycling rates of nutrients, as revealed from inorganic nutrient (N, P) addition experiments. 5. ER exceeded GPP in all streams (with average GPP/ER=0.6) and was more strongly related to temperature than GPP, resulting in elevated negative NEP with warming. We show that, as a first approximation based on summer investigations, global stream carbon emission to the atmosphere would nearly double from 0.12PgCyear-1 at 13°C to 0.21 (0.15-0.33) PgCyear-1 with a 5°C warming. 6. Compared to previous studies from natural systems (including terrestrial ecosystems), the temperature dependence of stream metabolism was not confounded by latitude or altitude, seasonality, light and nutrient availability, water chemistry, space availability (water transient storage), and water availability. 7. Consequently, stream nutrient processing is likely to increase with warming, protecting downstream ecosystems (rivers, estuaries, coastal marine systems) during the summer low flows from nutrient enrichment, but at the cost of increased CO2 flux back to the atmosphere. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem metabolism is an important determinant of trophic structure, nutrient cycling, and other critical ecosystem processes in streams. Whereas watershed- and local-scale controls on stream metabolism have been independently investigated, little is known about how controls exerted at different scales interact to determine stream metabolic rates, particularly in urban streams and across seasons. To address this knowledge gap, we measured ecosystem metabolism in four urban and four reference streams in northern Kentucky, USA, with paired closed and open riparian canopies, during each of the four seasons. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem production (NEP) were all best predicted by models with season as a main effect, but interactions between season, canopy, and watershed varied for each response. Urban streams exhibited higher GPP during most seasons, likely due to elevated nutrient loads. Open canopy reaches in both urban and forested streams, supported higher rates of GPP than the closed canopy which reaches during the summer and fall, when the overhead vegetation shaded the closed reaches. The effect of canopy cover on GPP was similar among urban and forested streams. The combination of watershed and local-scale controls resulted in urban streams that alternated between net heterotrophy (NEP {\textbackslash}textless0) and net autotrophy (NEP {\textbackslash}textgreater0) at the reach-scale during seasons with dense canopy cover. This finding has management relevance because net production can lead to accumulation of algal biomass and associated issues like nighttime hypoxia. Our study suggests that although watershed urbanization fundamentally alters ecosystem function, the preservation and restoration of canopied riparian zones can provide an important management tool at the local scale, with the strongest impacts on stream metabolism during summer.},

	abstract = {AbstractStream nutrient uptake and limitation are interconnected by relationships between nutrient supply and demand. We used multiple approaches, including estimates of nutrient supply, measures of stream metabolism derived from dissolved O2 curves, and nutrient-enrichment experiments, as complementary measures of nutrient supply, demand, and limitation in New Hope Creek, a 3rd-order stream in the Duke Forest of North Carolina. Over the course of 1 y of sampling, NO3?-N supply relative to demand (S?D) was large during winter (S?D = 133.4), spring (S?D = 62.0), and summer (S?D = 108.32). Potential N demand, estimated based on ecosystem metabolic rates, was measurable during winter, spring, and summer months, but we measured no N uptake in response to N addition from nutrient-enrichment experiments. In contrast, during autumn, declines in stream NO3?-N concentrations to annual minima (autumn concentration range 0.009?0.034 mg/L NO3?-N), and low S?D (1.84) induced transient N limitation, and NO3?-N enrichment stimulated increased uptake. We demonstrate that nutrient-enrichment experiments fail to detect uptake when nutrient concentrations are nonlimiting even when ambient biological uptake remains an important sink for the nutrient of interest. In addition, we present a conceptual model of ?supply?demand space? to aid interpretation of nutrient-enrichment data. Last, we suggest that simultaneous measures of nutrient supply, demand, uptake, and limitation can help define supply?demand relationships and provide a step toward a more robust understanding of biogeochemical cycling in streams.},

The ratio of total primary production to total community respiration is used to classify communities quantitatively according to their predominantly heterotrophic or autotrophic characteristics.

	abstract = {Ecosystem respiration is a primary component of the carbon cycle and understanding the mechanisms that determine its temperature dependence will be important for predicting how rates of carbon efflux might respond to global warming. We used a rare model system, comprising a network of geothermally heated streams ranging in temperature from 5 °C to 25 °C, to explore the nature of the relationship between respiration and temperature. Using this 'natural experiment', we tested whether the natal thermal regime of stream communities influenced the temperature dependence of respiration in the absence of other potentially confounding variables. An empirical survey of 13 streams across the thermal gradient revealed that the temperature dependence of whole-stream respiration was equivalent to the average activation energy of the respiratory complex (0.6-0.7 eV). This observation was also consistent for in-situ benthic respiration. Laboratory experiments, incubating biofilms from four streams across the thermal gradient at a range of temperatures, revealed that the activation energy and Q 10 of respiration were remarkably consistent across streams, despite marked differences in their thermal history and significant turnover in species composition. Furthermore, absolute rates of respiration at standardised temperature were also unrelated to ambient stream temperature, but strongly reflected differences in biofilm biomass. Together, our results suggest that the core biochemistry, which drives the kinetics of oxidative respiratory metabolism, may be well conserved among diverse taxa and environments, and that the intrinsic sensitivity of respiration to temperature is not influenced by ambient environmental temperature. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We estimated reach-scale GPP in five locations of the regulated Colorado River in Grand Canyon using an open channel model of dissolved oxygen. Benthic GPP dominates in Grand Canyon due to fast transport times and low pelagic algal biomass. In one location, we used a 738 days time series of GPP to identify the relative contribution of different physical controls of GPP. We developed both linear and semimechanistic time series models that account for unmeasured temporal covariance due to factors such as algal biomass dynamics. GPP varied from 0 g O2 m−2 d−1 to 3.0 g O2 m−2 d−1 with a relatively low annual average of 0.8 g O2 m−2 d−1. Semimechanistic models fit the data better than linear models and demonstrated that variation in turbidity primarily controlled GPP. Lower solar insolation during winter and from cloud cover lowered GPP much further. Hydropeaking lowered GPP but only during turbid conditions. Using the best model and parameter values, the model accurately predicted seasonal estimates of GPP at 3 of 4 upriver sites and outperformed the linear model at all sites; discrepancies were likely from higher algal biomass at upstream sites. This modeling approach can predict how changes in physical controls will affect relative rates of GPP throughout the 385 km segment of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon and can be easily applied to other streams and rivers.},

	abstract = {1. Stream ecosystem metabolism integrates production and respiration of organic matter and plays a fundamental role in the global carbon (C) cycle. Several studies have identified distal and proximal physical controls, for example, land use and transient storage, or the effects of water chemistry, that is, organic matter and nutrient availability, on stream metabolism. In parallel, research on organic matter quality has identified conspicuous gradients of chemical composition, yet mostly without demonstrating any functional implications. 2. We hypothesise that organic matter holds a key position in a more comprehensive causal framework of stream ecosystem metabolism, and that a concurrent study can improve mechanistic understanding. Specifically, we here postulate that dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, that is, its chemical composition, acts as a control of ecosystem respiration (ER) as much as it is a result of gross primary production (GPP). As such, DOM quality likely forms a central link between land use and stream metabolism, besides known physical controls including transient storage and light availability. 3. To examine these hypotheses, we studied 33 streams in north-eastern Austria, a region with diverse land use ranging from semi-natural, forested areas to agricultural areas and settlements. We analysed DOM composition by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, including modelling excitation–emission matrices with parallel factor analysis. We then opposed these data to GPP and ER estimated by fitting a metabolism model to single-station diurnal oxygen records. 4. Structural equation modelling revealed land use as a control on light conditions, DOM composition and concentration and nutrient concentrations, which together ultimately shaped GPP and ER. In particular, humified, coloured and aromatic DOM of predominantly terrestrial origin was prevalent in coniferous forest catchments and increased stream ER. Agricultural and urban areas enriched streams with phosphorous and nitrogen, which increased ER and GPP. Besides nutrients, GPP seemed to be weakly correlated with light availability and – in contrast to our hypothesis – left only a weak imprint on DOM composition. 5. Land-use change is rated as the most pervasive human influence on natural ecosystems and our results highlight its impact on aquatic GPP and ER in streams. To understand the role of inland waters in the global C cycle will require mechanistic understanding of ecosystem metabolism, which notably includes organic matter quality as a hitherto underappreciated key player.},

	abstract = {1. Rates of whole-system metabolism (production and respiration) are fundamental indicators of ecosystem structure and function. Although first-order, proximal controls are well understood, assessments of the interactions between proximal controls and distal controls, such as land use and geographic region, are lacking. Thus, the influence of land use on stream metabolism across geographic regions is unknown. Further, there is limited understanding of how land use may alter variability in ecosystem metabolism across regions.2. Stream metabolism was measured in nine streams in each of eight regions (n = 72) across the United States and Puerto Rico. In each region, three streams were selected from a range of three land uses: agriculturally influenced, urban-influenced, and reference streams. Stream metabolism was estimated from diel changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in each stream reach with correction for reaeration and groundwater input.3. Gross primary production (GPP) was highest in regions with little riparian vegetation (sagebrush steppe in Wyoming, desert shrub in Arizona/New Mexico) and lowest in forested regions (North Carolina, Oregon). In contrast, ecosystem respiration (ER) varied both within and among regions. Reference streams had significantly lower rates of GPP than urban or agriculturally influenced streams.4. GPP was positively correlated with photosynthetically active radiation and autotrophic biomass. Multiple regression models compared using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) indicated GPP increased with water column ammonium and the fraction of the catchment in urban and reference land-use categories. Multiple regression models also identified velocity, temperature, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, GPP, coarse benthic organic matter, fine benthic organic matter and the fraction of all land-use categories in the catchment as regulators of ER.5. Structural equation modelling indicated significant distal as well as proximal control pathways including a direct effect of land-use on GPP as well as SRP, DIN, and PAR effects on GPP; GPP effects on autotrophic biomass, organic matter, and ER; and organic matter effects on ER.6. Overall, consideration of the data separated by land-use categories showed reduced inter-regional variability in rates of metabolism, indicating that the influence of agricultural and urban land use can obscure regional differences in stream metabolism. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

However, estimates of me-tabolism in small streams outnumber those from rivers such that there are limited empirical data comparing metabolism across a range of stream and river sizes. We measured metabolism in 14 rivers (discharge range 14–84 m 3 s -1) in the Western and Midwestern United States (US). We estimated GPP, ER, and gas exchange rates using a Lagrangian, 2-station oxygen model solved in a Bayesian framework. GPP ranged from 0.6–22 g O 2 m -2 d -1 and ER tracked GPP, suggesting that autotrophic production supports much of riverine ER in summer. Net ecosystem production, the balance between GPP and ER was 0 or greater in 4 rivers showing autotrophy on that day. River velocity and slope predicted gas exchange estimates from these 14 rivers in agreement with empirical models. Carbon turnover lengths (that is, the distance traveled be-fore OC is mineralized to CO 2) ranged from 38 to 1190 km, with the longest turnover lengths in high-sediment, arid-land rivers. We also compared estimated turnover lengths with the relative length of the river segment between major tributaries or lakes; the mean ratio of carbon turnover length to river length was 1.6, demonstrating that rivers can mineralize much of the OC load along their length at baseflow. Carbon mineralization velocities ran-ged from 0.05 to 0.81 m d -1 , and were not differ-ent than measurements from small streams. Given high GPP relative to ER, combined with generally short OC spiraling lengths, rivers can be highly reactive with regard to OC cycling.},

	abstract = {Structural equation modeling is an advanced multivariate statistical process with which a researcher can construct theoretical concepts, test their measurement reliability, hypothesize and test a theory about their relationships, take into account measurement errors, and consider both direct and indirect effects of variables on one another. Latent variables are theoretical concepts that unite phenomena under a single term, e.g., ecosystem health, environmental condition, and pollution (Bollen, 1989). Latent variables are not measured directly but can be expressed in terms of one or more directly measurable variables called indicators. For some researchers, defining, constructing, and examining the validity of latent variables may be the end task of itself. For others, testing hypothesized relationships of latent variables may be of interest. We analyzed the correlation matrix of eleven environmental variables from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program for Estuaries (EMAP-E) using methods of structural equation modeling. We hypothesized and tested a conceptual model to characterize the interdependencies between four latent variables-sediment contamination, natural variability, biodiversity, and growth potential. In particular, we were interested in measuring the direct, indirect, and total effects of sediment contamination and natural variability on biodiversity and growth potential. The model fit the data well and accounted for 81\% of the variability in biodiversity and 69\% of the variability in growth potential. It revealed a positive total effect of natural variability on growth potential that otherwise would have been judged negative had we not considered indirect effects. That is, natural variability had a negative direct effect on growth potential of magnitude -0.3251 and a positive indirect effect mediated through biodiversity of magnitude 0.4509, yielding a net positive total effect of 0.1258. Natural variability had a positive direct effect on biodiversity of magnitude 0.5347 and a negative indirect effect mediated through growth potential of magnitude -0.1105 yielding a positive total effects of magnitude 0.4242. Sediment contamination had a negative direct effect on biodiversity of magnitude -0.1956 and a negative indirect effect on growth potential via biodiversity of magnitude -0.067. Biodiversity had a positive effect on growth potential of magnitude 0.8432, and growth potential had a positive effect on biodiversity of magnitude 0.3398. The correlation between biodiversity and growth potential was estimated at 0.7658 and that between sediment contamination and natural variability at -0.3769.},

	abstract = {The hyporheic zone is a region underneath streambeds that integrates surface and groundwater. Although its location is central to biogeochemical linkages between the riparian zone, dissolved nutrients, and benthic biota, the seasonal quality and likely sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the hyporheic zone are not well understood. To investigate DOM characteristics in the hyporheic zone, water from the surface and subsurface (at depths 20, 60, and 100 cm below the streambed) was sampled every 4 weeks from 2007 to 2008 in a third-order stream in southern Ontario. Using UV spectroscopy, measures of spectral slopes, aromaticity, and A254/A365 ratios (molecular weight) were obtained. Temporal changes in these measures were consistent with watershed processes such as shedding of leaf litter in the fall, and photochemical and biofilm influence in the spring and summer. The fluorescence index (a measure of relative DOM source) suggested that at the surface and in the downwelling zone, DOM microbial sources increased with depth in the sediment, regardless of the season. Excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) showed seasonally distinct, protein-like DOM components of bacterial origin that were stronger in the fall. Leachates from specific allochthonous DOM sources-leaf litter from Betula papyrifera (white birch) and Thuja occidentalis (white cedar)-and an autochthonous source, biofilm, were isolated and incubated with unfiltered surface water. EEMs from these leachates indicated that these sources could indeed help explain observed patterns of DOM in surface and subsurface waters. These results suggest that although DOM sources were relatively constant, biogeochemical processing within the hyporheic zone resulted a DOM pool that was temporally dynamic and altered the nature of organic matter transported downstream into lakes and rivers. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

	abstract = {Human activities have altered the environmental controls on river metabolism, i.e., gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). These coupled processes affect water quality, CO2 emissions, and biodi- versity. Efforts to mitigate these impacts often lack long-term, high-resolution data needed to assess their suc- cess. Here, we estimated a 20-yr time series of daily metabolism from dissolved oxygen (DO) data following pollution abatement (sewage treatment) in the Oria River, Spain. Ammonium concentration declined immedi- ately after sewage abatement, whereas dissolved organic matter absorbance (proxy for concentration) declined slowly. Summer GPP declined with ammonium concentration. ER declined more strongly but more gradually than GPP and was driven by lower rates of autotrophic respiration (AR) and heterotrophic respiration following sewage treatment. Reduced AR reflected a decrease in the fraction of daily GPP being respired by algae them- selves. Decline in ER caused net ecosystem production to increase from highly negative to approximately zero. Diel DO swings also declined and episodes of hypoxia nearly disappeared following reduced metabolic rates, and were paralleled by lower benthic chlorophyll a, increased macroinvertebrate indices, and a recovery of fish assemblages. Overall, wastewater treatment plants installation constrained river metabolism, greatly improved water quality, and enabled invertebrates and fish to recolonize the river. However, most variables responded gradually and these changes would not have been evident with short-term DO data. These gradual responses revealed the need of long-term, high-resolution data to gain insight into long-temporal scale responses superim- posed on short-temporal scale metabolic variation, especially in the current context of climate and land-use change.},

SUVA, therefore, is shown to be a useful parameter for estimating the dissolved aromatic carbon content in aquatic systems. Experiments involving the reactivity of DOC with chlorine and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), however, show a wide range of reactivity for samples with similar SUVA values.

	abstract = {The objective of this chapter is to examine and synthesize the published literature with respect to the sources and production of terrestrially derived Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), its relationship with Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON), and the mechanistic controls on their export from terrestrial ecosystems to surface waters. Allochthonous dissolved organic matter is a source of organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur to aquatic systems that is derived from the surrounding terrestrial ecosystem. Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) is produced as precipitation moves through the atmosphere, washes through vegetation, infiltrates the soil organic horizon, and percolates downward through mineral soil horizons. Organic forms of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus contribute to bulk DOM. The contribution of mineral soil solution DOM to allochthonous inputs will depend on: (1) watershed slope, (2) depth of water table, (3) antecedent soil moisture, and (4) barriers to organic soil solution infiltration of the mineral soil. Delivery of terrestrially derived DOC and DON to the surface waters depends on the balance between production and loss from solution, and the opportunity for hydrological transport. Large fluxes of atlochthonous DOM to surface waters occur when there is a barrier precluding water infiltration of the soil column. Saturated soils— such as wetlands and peatlands also tend to produce runoff with higher DOC concentrations.},

	abstract = {The potential for rivers to alter the flux of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from land to ocean is widely accepted. Yet anticipating when and where rivers behave as active reactors vs. passive pipes of DOM stands as a major knowledge gap in river biogeochemistry, resulting in uncertainties for global carbon models. Here, we investigate the controls on in-stream DOM dynamics by evaluating changes in DOM concentration and composition along several reaches of a medium-sized river network over one full hydrological year. Roughly half of the observations over time and space showed active reactor conditions and, among these, similar proportion of gains and losses was measured. High water residence times promoted the active over passive behavior of the reaches, while DOM properties and nitrate availability determined whether they supplied or removed DOM from the river. Among different DOM fractions, protein-like DOM both of terrestrial and aquatic origin seemed to drive bulk DOM patterns. Our study emphasizes the role of water residence time as a physical constraint for in-stream processes, and provides new insights into the key factors governing the net balance between in-stream gains and losses of DOM in rivers.},

	abstract = {Although stream ecosystems are recognized as an important component of the global carbon cycle, the impacts of climate-induced hydrological extremes on carbon fluxes in stream networks remain unclear. Using continuous measurements of ecosystem metabolism, we report on the effects of changes in snowmelt hydrology during the anomalously warm winter 2013/2014 on gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem production (NEP) in an Alpine stream network. We estimated ecosystem metabolism across 12 study reaches of the 254 km2 subalpine Ybbs River Network (YRN), Austria, for 18 months. During spring snowmelt, GPP peaked in 10 of our 12 study reaches, which appeared to be driven by PAR and catchment area. In contrast, the winter precipitation shift from snow to rain following the low-snow winter in 2013/2014 increased spring ER in upper elevation catchments, causing spring NEP to shift from autotrophy to heterotrophy. Our findings suggest that the YRN transitioned from a transient sink to a source of carbon dioxide (CO2) in spring as snowmelt hydrology differed following the high-snow versus low-snow winter. This shift toward increased heterotrophy during spring snowmelt following a warm winter has potential consequences for annual ecosystem metabolism, as spring GPP contributed on average 33\% to annual GPP fluxes compared to spring ER, which averaged 21\% of annual ER fluxes. We propose that Alpine headwaters will emit more within-stream respiratory CO2 to the atmosphere while providing less autochthonous organic energy to downstream ecosystems as the climate gets warmer.},

Two distinct spectral slope regions (275295 nm and 350400 nm) within log-transformed absorption spectra were used to compare DOM from contrasting water types, ranging from wetlands (Great Dismal Swamp and Suwannee River) to photobleached oceanic water (Atlantic Ocean). On the basis of DOM size-fractionation studies (ultrafiltration and gel filtration chromatography), the slope of the 275295-nm region and the ratio of these slopes (SR; 275295-nm slope : 350400-nm slope) were related to DOM molecular weight (MW) and to photochemically induced shifts in MW. Dark aerobic microbial alteration of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) resulted in spectral slope changes opposite of those caused by photochemistry. Along an axial transect in the Delaware Estuary, large variations in SR were measured, probably due to mixing, photodegradation, and microbial alteration of CDOM as terrestrially derived DOM transited through the estuary. Further, SR varied by over a factor of 13 between DOM-rich wetland waters and Sargasso Sea surface waters. Currently, there is no consensus on a wavelength range for log-transformed absorption spectra. We propose that the 275295-nm slope be routinely reported in future DOM studies, as it can be measured with high precision, it facilitates comparison among dissimilar water types including CDOM-rich wetland and CDOM-poor marine waters, and it appears to be a good proxy for DOM MW.},

The magnitude of the diffuse inputs is related to river water discharge so that the size and rotation of the hysteresis loop is characterized by a single parameter. The approach is applied to chemical and water discharge data collected at 2 h intervals from three river sites in the catchment over a complete storm hydrograph. The results illustrate hysteresis effects for all the determinants with the majority showing 'clockwise' hysteresis, i.e. higher concentrations during the rising limb of the hydrograph compared with those measured during the falling limb. The model parameters, computed by optimizing agreement between the predicted and measured concentration-discharge relationships, are generally consistent with land-use patterns in the catchment. The method has potential for further development to enable comparisons of chemical and nutrient dynamics in river catchments and the assessment of the relative importance of diffuse and point sources during high flow conditions.},

	abstract = {© 2016 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography. Streams and rivers transport dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the terrestrial environment to downstream ecosystems. In light of climate and global change it is crucial to understand the temporal dynamics of DOM concentration and composition, and its export fluxes from headwaters to larger downstream ecosystems. We monitored DOM concentration and composition based on a diurnal sampling design for 3 years in an Alpine headwater stream. We found hydrologic variability to control DOM composition and the coupling of DOM dynamics in the streamwater and the hyporheic zone. High-flow events increased DOM inputs from terrestrial sources (as indicated by the contributions of humic- and fulvic-like fluorescence), while summer baseflow enhanced the autochthonous imprint of DOM. Diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM composition were likely induced by biological processes linked to temperature and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Floods frequently interrupted diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM, which led to a decoupling of streamwater and hyporheic water DOM composition and delivery of aromatic and humic-like DOM to the streamwater. Accordingly, DOM export fluxes were largely of terrigenous origin as indicated by optical properties. Our study highlights the relevance of hydrologic and seasonal dynamics for the origin, composition and fluxes of DOM in an Alpine headwater stream.},

	abstract = {1. Agriculture is a major contributor of non-point source pollution to surface waters in the midwestern United States, resulting in eutrophication of freshwater aquatic ecosystems and development of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Agriculturally influenced streams are diverse in morphology and have variable nutrient concentrations. Understanding how nutrients are transformed and retained within agricultural streams may aid in mitigating increased nutrient export to downstream ecosystems. 2. We studied six agriculturally influenced streams in Indiana and Michigan to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling nutrient retention and export in agricultural streams using nutrient addition and isotopic tracer studies. 3. Metrics of nutrient uptake indicated that nitrate uptake was saturated in these streams whereas ammonium and phosphorus uptake increased with higher concentrations. Phosphorus uptake was likely approaching saturation as evidenced by decreasing uptake velocities with concentration; ammonium uptake velocity also declined with concentration, though not significantly. 4. Higher whole-stream uptake rates of phosphorus and ammonium were associated with the observed presence of stream autotrophs (e.g. algae and macrophytes). However, there was no significant relationship between measures of nutrient uptake and stream metabolism. Water-column nutrient concentrations were positively correlated with gross primary production but not community respiration. 5. Overall, nutrient uptake and metabolism were affected by nutrient concentrations in these agriculturally influenced streams. Biological uptake of ammonium and phosphorus was not saturated, although nitrate uptake did appear to be saturated in these ecosystems. Biological activity in agriculturally influenced streams is higher relative to more pristine streams and this increased biological activity likely influences nutrient retention and transport to downstream ecosystems. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {1. Primary production and respiration in streams, collectively referred to as stream ecosystem metabolism, are fundamental processes that determine trophic structure, biomass and nutrient cycling. Few studies have used high-frequency measurements of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) over extended periods to characterise the factors that control stream ecosystem metabolism at hourly, daily, seasonal and annual scales. 2. We measured ecosystem metabolism at 5-min intervals for 23 months in Shepherd Creek, a small suburban stream in Cincinnati, Ohio (U.S.A.). 3. Daily GPP was best predicted by a model containing light and its synergistic interaction with water temperature. Water temperature alone was not significantly related to daily GPP, rather high temperatures enhanced the capacity of autotrophs to use available light. 4. The relationship between GPP and light was further explored using photosynthesis–irradiance curves (P–I curves). Light saturation of GPP was evident throughout the winter and spring and the P–I curve frequently exhibited strong counterclockwise hysteresis. Hysteresis occurred when water temperatures were greater in the afternoon than in the morning, although light was similar, further suggesting that light availability interacts synergistically with water temperature. 5. Storm flows strongly depressed GPP in the spring while desiccation arrested aquatic GPP and ER in late summer and autumn. 6. Ecosystem respiration was best predicted by GPP, water temperature and the rate of water exchange between the surface channel and transient storage zones. We estimate that c. 70\% of newly fixed carbon was immediately respired by autotrophs and closely associated heterotrophs. 7. Interannual, seasonal, daily and hourly variability in ecosystem metabolism was attributable to a combination of light availability, water temperature, storm flow dynamics and desiccation. Human activities affect all these factors in urban and suburban streams, suggesting stream ecosystem processes are likely to respond in complex ways to changing land use and climate.},

The temperature dependence of GPP is directly linked to photosynthetic physiology, but the response of GPP to warming over longer timescales could also be shaped by ecological and evolutionary processes that drive variation in community structure and functional trait distributions. Here, we show that selection on photosynthetic traits within and across taxa dampens the effects of temperature on GPP across a catchment of geothermally heated streams. Autotrophs from cold streams had higher photosynthetic rates and after accounting for differences in biomass among sites, biomass-specific GPP was independent of temperature in spite of a 20 °C thermal gradient. Our results suggest that temperature compensation of photosynthetic rates constrains the long-term temperature dependence of GPP, and highlights the importance of considering physiological, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms when predicting how ecosystem-level processes respond to warming.},

Among organisms inhabiting running waters, what adaptations exist for surviving floods and droughts? How will the alteration of the frequency, timing and duration of flow extremes affect flood- and drought-adapted organisms? How rapidly can populations evolve in response to altered flow regimes? Here, we identify three modes of adaptation (life history, behavioral and morphological) that plants and animals use to survive floods and/or droughts. The mode of adaptation that an organism has determines its vulnerability to different kinds of flow regime alteration. The rate of evolution in response to flow regime alteration remains an open question. Because humans have now altered the flow regimes of most rivers and many streams, understanding the link between fitness and flow regime is crucial for the effective management and restoration of running water ecosystems.},

The streams studied had climates ranging from tropical to cool-temperate and from humid to arid and were all relatively unin¯uenced by human disturbances. 2. Rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined using the open-system, two-station diurnal oxygen change method. 3. Three general patterns in metabolism were evident among streams: (1) relatively high GPP with positive NEP (i.e. net oxygen production) in early afternoon, (2) moderate primary production with a distinct peak in GPP during daylight but negative NEP at all times and (3) little or no evidence of GPP during daylight and a relatively constant and negative NEP over the entire day. 4. Gross primary production was most strongly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). A multiple regression model that included log PAR and stream water soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration explained 90\%of the variation in log GPP. 5. Ecosystem respiration was signi®cantly correlated with SRP concentration and size of the transient storage zone and, together, these factors explained 73\% of the variation in R. The rate of R was poorly correlated with the rate of GPP. 6. Net ecosystem production was signi®cantly correlated only with PAR, with 53\% of the variation in log NEP explained by log PAR. Only Sycamore Creek, a desert stream in Arizona, had positive NEP (GPP: R {\textbackslash}textgreater 1), supporting the idea that streams are generally net sinks rather than net sources of organic matter.

	doi = {10/dgbgfq},
	abstract = {During the past decade, significant spatial and temporal variability in the release of nitrate-nitrogen (N) from catchments in a sugar maple forest in central Ontario was observed. To explain this variability, we tested the flushing hypothesis [Hornberger et al., 1994], where, when the soil saturation deficit is high, N accumulates in the upper layers of the soil and, as the soil saturation deficit decreases, the formation of a saturated subsurface layer flushes N from the upper layers of the soil into the stream. We used the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System to simulate water, carbon, and N dynamics. A N flushing index was modeled as S/S30, the ratio of the current day saturation deficit to the previous 30-day average saturation deficit. A N source index was modeled as the ratio of N supply/demand. The relationship between the simulated N indices and the observed release of N indicated two mechanisms for the release of N from catchments: (1) a N flushing mechanism, where the N-enriched upper layer of the soil is flushed, after a period of low demand for N by the forest (e.g., during spring snowmelt and autumn stormflow, the water table rising into previously unsaturated parts of a N-enriched soil profile) or after a period of high demand for N by the forest (e.g., during summer droughts, the water table rising into previously saturated parts of a N-impoverished soil profile following a period of enhanced rates of nitrification); and (2) a N draining mechanism, where spring snowmelt recharge of the groundwater translocates N from the upper layer of the soil into deeper hydrological flow pathways that are released slowly over the year.},

	abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y(-1) from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y(-1) is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

The upper reach at 655 m above sea level (a.s.l.) is bedrock constrained, has a high slope (0.60\%) and a catchment area of 126 km(2). The lower reach at 370 m a.s.l. has a more extensive hyporheic zone, a lower slope (0.17\%) and a catchment of 1696 km(2). 2. In both reaches, temporal patterns of stream metabolism reflected the occurrence of bed-moving spates. Average reductions of GPP and ER by spates were 53 and 24\% in the upper reach, and 37 and 14\% in the lower reach, respectively. The greater resistance of ER than GPP in both reaches shifted the ecosystem metabolism towards heterotrophy (decrease of the ratio of GPP to ER (P/R)) following spates. 3. Recovery of GPP was significantly faster in the lower reach and exhibited distinct seasonal variation (positive correlation with incident light). The differences in stability (both resistance and resilience) between reaches reflected differences in geomorphic settings and disturbance regime. 4. Stepwise regression analysis was used to explore the potential influence of season, disturbance and prevailing environmental conditions on stream metabolism in each reach. Time since spate plus temperature explained 73 and 86\% of variation in ER and GPP, respectively, in the upper reach and 55\% of variation in ER in the lower reach. Season plus prevailing environmental conditions explained 67\% of variation in GPP in the lower reach. 5. To test how the perception of stability may change with increasing scale of observation, the disturbance regimes of 12 sites were compared with the disturbance regime of the entire Thur catchment. The analysis suggests that stream metabolism at the catchment scale is far more resistant to high flow events than at the reach scale.},

	abstract = {Most methods for assessing the ecological status of streams focus on structural characteristics (water quality, community composition, riparian vegetation) but neglect functional properties of the ecosystem because routine methods to assess stream function are scarce. Metabolism, one of the most integrative ecosystem functions, can be a good indicator of stream function because it is relevant across all sizes and types of streams, is sensitive to stressors, such as eutrophication or changes in riparian cover, and can be measured continuously. Environmental controls on whole-ecosystem metabolism were measured at 19 contrasting stream reaches in the Basque Country (northern Spain). Discharge, temperature, and O2 were monitored continuously for 15 mo, reaeration rate was calculated with the nighttime regression method, and whole-stream metabolism was calculated by the single-station open-channel method. The effect of discharge on reaeration coefficients was highly site-specific. Average gross primary production (GPP) ranged from 2.7 to 11.0 g O2 m!2 d!1, was highest at eutrophic sites, and showed no relationship with periphyton biomass. Ecosystem respiration (ER) ranged from 6.3 to 42.6 g O2 m!2 d!1 and was highest at polluted sites. Differences among sites increased in summer. All sites were heterotrophic on an annual basis, but 3 were autotrophic during summer. Turbidity was the main controller of primary production during summer and explained 20\% and 39\% of the spatial variation in GPP and net ecosystem production, respectively.

Stream metabolism was measured using an open-system ap- proach each month during spring-summer in a semi-arid tailwater (South Fork Humboldt River) in the central Great Basin, USA. Spatial and tem- poral differences in metabolic rates were evident despite tailwater reaches sustaining comparable standing stocks of periphyton ({\textbackslash}textgreater10µg chla cm?2) during this growing season. Primary productivity was highest (15 to 36g O2m?2 day?1) in July, supporting previous studies that have described arid regulated/unregulated streams as ultra-productive. Substrate availability when combined with self-shading and hypoxic conditions created a system that was likely near the maximal productivity that stream systems can achieve because of the self-regulating attributes that thick periphyton mats impose upon themselves as they reach high biomass and maximal production rates.},

We used a stable isotope tracer of nitrogen (15N) to measure nitrate (NO3−) uptake, storage, and export in a mountain stream, Spring Creek, Idaho, U.S.A. We conducted two tracer tests of 2-week duration during snowmelt and baseflow. Dissolved and particulate forms of 15N were monitored over three seasons to test the hypothesis that stream N cycling would be dominated by export during floods, and storage during low flow. Floods exported more N than during baseflow conditions; however, snowmelt floods had higher than expected demand for NO3− because of hyporheic exchange. residence times of benthic N during both tracer tests were longer than 100 d for ephemeral pools such as benthic algae and wood biofilms. Residence times were much longer in fine detritus, insects, and the particulate N from the hyporheic zone, showing that assimilation and hydrologic storage can be important mechanisms for retaining particulate N. Of the tracer N stored in the stream, the primary form of export was via seston during periods of high flows, produced by summer rainstorms or spring snowmelt the following year. Spring Creek is not necessarily a conduit for nutrients during high flow; hydrologic exchange between the stream and its valley represents an important storage mechanism.},

Here, we combine recent findings from geophysics, microbial ecology and organic geochemistry to show geophysical opportunity and microbial capacity to enhance the net heterotrophy in streams, rivers and estuaries. We identify hydrological storage and retention zones that extend the residence time of organic carbon during downstream transport as geophysical opportunities for microorganisms to develop as attached biofilms or suspended aggregates, and to metabolize organic carbon for energy and growth. We consider fluvial networks as meta-ecosystems to include the acclimation of microbial communities in downstream ecosystems that enable them to exploit energy that escapes from upstream ecosystems, thereby increasing the overall energy utilization at the network level. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Headwater streams are key sites of nutrient and organic matter processing and retention, but little is known about temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates as a result of the short duration of most metabolism measurements in lotic ecosystems. We examined temporal variability and controls on ecosystem metabolism by measuring daily rates continuously for 2 years in Walker Branch, a first-order deciduous forest stream. Four important scales of temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism rates were identified: (1) seasonal, (2) day-to-day, (3) episodic (storm-related), and (4) inter-annual. Seasonal patterns were largely controlled by the leaf phenology and productivity of the deciduous riparian forest. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic throughout the year with the exception of the open-canopy spring when GPP and ER rates were co-equal. Day-to-day variability in weather conditions influenced light reaching the streambed, resulting in high day-to-day variability in GPP particularly during spring (daily light levels explained 84\% of the variance in daily GPP in April). Episodic storms depressed GPP for several days in spring, but increased GPP in autumn by removing leaves shading the streambed. Storms depressed ER initially, but then stimulated ER to 2-3 times pre-storm levels for several days. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic in both years of the study, with annual GPP being similar (488 and 519 g O2 m-2y-1 or 183 and 195 g C m-2 y-1) but annual ER being higher in 2004 than 2005 (-1,645 vs. -1,292 g O2 m-2 y-1 or -617 and -485 g C m-2 y-1). Inter-annual variability in ecosystem metabolism (assessed by comparing 2004 and 2005 rates with previous measurements) was the result of the storm frequency and timing and the size of the spring macroalgal bloom. Changes in local climate can have substantial impacts on stream ecosystem metabolism rates and ultimately influence the carbon source and sink properties of these important ecosystems. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

We found that the gas transfer velocity scales with the product of stream slope and velocity, which is in alignment with theory on stream energy dissipation. In addition to providing equations that predict the gas transfer velocity based on stream hydraulics, we used our hydraulic data set to report a new set of hydraulic exponents and coefficients that allow the prediction of stream width, depth, and velocity based on discharge. Finally, we report a new table of gas Schmidt number dependencies to allow researchers to estimate a gas transfer velocity using our equation for many gasses of interest.},

	abstract = {Important ecological services of low-order streams are greatly affected by urbanization. North Buffalo Creek, in the headwaters of the Cape Fear River basin in Greensboro, North Carolina, receives point- and nonpoint-source pollutants. Natural abundances of the stable isotopes of C (C-13) and N (N-15) were used to determine the influence of anthropogenic nutrients on seston delta(15)N, nutrient concentrations, C/N ratios, and patterns of delta(13)C and delta(15)N in foodweb components in North Buffalo Creek during different hydrological conditions. Baseflow seston delta(15)N varied significantly among sampling sites. Baseflow seston delta(15)N ranged from 3.7 parts per thousand to 4.6 parts per thousand at forested sites and was slightly enriched at open sites, and probably reflected nonpoint sources of N in North Buffalo Creek. Seston delta(15)N also reflected point sources of N in North Buffalo Creek. The most enriched seston delta(15)N values (8.4 parts per thousand) were found directly downstream of the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). Seston delta(15)N values at the Rankin Mill Road (Rankin) site, several km downstream of the WWTP, also were strongly influenced by effluent from the WWTP. The Summit Avenue site (Summit) received textile effluent until June 2001. Before lone 2001, seston N-15 at Summit was depleted compared to seston N-15 at sites upstream of the plant, probably because the textile effluent was depleted in N-15. During storms, seston delta(15)N was negatively correlated with nutrient concentrations upstream of the WWTP. However, at Rankin Mill Road, seston delta(15)N was positively correlated with NO3- flux, which explained 54\% of the variation in seston delta(15)N. delta(15)N was not correlated with NH4+ and PO4-3 fluxes at Rankin Mill Road. During storms, seston delta(15)N was influenced partially by nonpoint sources of N, a pattern consistent with observed C/N ratios. delta(13)C values for most foodweb components and delta(15)N values for all foodweb components varied significantly between sites, suggesting that sources of C and N differed among sites. Foodweb components at Rankin were enriched in N-15 from incorporation of sewage-derived N from the WWTP effluent, whereas, prior to June 2001, foodweb components at Summit appeared to be depleted in N-15 from incorporation of textile effluent. Thus, specific influences of point sources of N could be distinguished in foodweb components. Nonpoint sources and stormwater influenced seston delta(15)N during storm events, but these sources could not be distinguished in consumers by using natural abundances of stable isotopes.},

	abstract = {Headwater streams draining urbanized watersheds are subject to frequent and intense storm flows. These floods can disrupt metabolic processes occurring in benthic biofilms via the removal of biomass (i.e., scouring flows, bed mobilization) or light attenuation due to turbidity. Furthermore, channel incision caused by frequent hydraulic disturbance alters the geomorphology of streams, indirectly changing the flow and light regimes experienced by benthic biofilms. We measured dissolved oxygen (DO) and modeled whole-stream metabolism for 18 months in six urban headwater streams in the North Carolina Piedmont, U.S.A. All streams were heterotrophic and had low rates of productivity despite relatively high streamwater nutrient concentrations. Light availability at the channel surface explained more of the day to day variation in gross primary productivity within each stream than did hydrologic disturbance. Yet among streams, the explanatory power of light declined with increasing hydrologic flashiness. We found a surprisingly wide range in DO regimes, which ranged from frequent hypoxia to near constant saturation. Hypoxia was more common in streams with lower channel gradients where bedrock outcrop-pings and culverts create rapid slope transitions between pools. We hypothesize this geomorphic change increases the susceptibility of benthic biota to perturbation during storms and the mean water residence time during base-flow. Increased water residence times together with elevated organic matter and nutrient inputs can set up ideal conditions for hypoxia at baseflows punctuated by frequent scouring storm flows. As a result, benthic biota are caught between hydrologic and chemical extremes that constrain their productivity. The flow regime of a stream is defined by the magnitude, frequency, timing, and duration of hydrologic fluxes, which together encapsulate the set of dominant physical processes governing a stream's bioenergetic capacity. Environmental changes that modify the characteristics of a stream's natural flow regime (Poff et al. 1997) can alter a stream's morphology (Wolman 1967; Arnold et al. 1982; Trimble 1997), as well as the ecological communities (Power et al. 1988) and processes (Stanley et al. 2010) that it supports. Forecasts for hydrocli-matic change in the 21 st century predict greater variability in precipitation across the globe (Milly et al. 2005; Swain et al. 2018) leading to altered drought and flood disturbance regimes with unclear consequences for lotic ecosystems. Stream ecosystems draining highly urbanized areas are some of the most extreme cases of altered hydrologic regimes (Konrad and Booth 2005; Walsh et al. 2005). The hydrology of urban streams tends to be "flashy," having an increased frequency and magnitude of erosive flows during storms of all sizes (Leopold 1968; Booth and Jackson 1997). These flows are large enough to cause hydraulic disturbance to biota (Wang et al. 2000; Roy et al. 2005; Walsh et al. 2005), channel incision , and bank erosion (Wolman 1967; Arnold et al. 1982; Trimble 1997). While flashy hydrology has been shown to have a consistent negative effect on macro-organisms (Paul and Meyer 2001; Walsh et al. 2005), the impacts on stream bioenergetics driven by algae and bacteria are less clear (Wenger et al. 2009; Bernot et al. 2010; Kaushal and Belt 2012). Urban watersheds provide an opportunity to study streams that span a wide range in hydrologic flashiness within a small physiographic region because the impacts of urbanization on streams are highly variable at intermediate levels of development (Somers et al.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic C (DOC) is metabolically important in streams, but its contribution to ecosystem metabolism is not well known because it is a complex mixture of mostly unidentified molecules. The uptake of bioavailable DOC in White Clay Creek (WCC), a 3rd-order stream in Pennsylvania, was estimated from the results of an experiment using 13C-labeled tree-tissue leachate and streambed sediments in recirculating mesocosms. The contribution of DOC in transport to stream metabolism was estimated from measurements of 13C-DOC uptake, 12C-DOC concentrations, and diel changes in dissolved O2 in the mesocosms. Eighty percent (±5) of the DOC in the 13C-tree-tissue leachate was bioavailable and belonged to 1 of 2 distinct lability classes, readily and intermediately labile. These components made up 88\% (±0.6) and 12\% (±0.6), respectively, of the biodegradable DOC in the leachate. Uptake mass transfer coefficients for the readily and intermediately labile components were 55 (±24) μm/s and 2.6 (±0.13) μm/s, respectively. Based on our mesocosm measurements, DOC in transport could support 33 to 54\% of the bacterial C demand and up to 51\% of the community respiration in WCC. Extrapolation of our results to WCC indicates that readily and intermediately labile DOC similar in quality to the 13C-DOC would travel 175 and 3692 m downstream in WCC before being taken up by the sediments. These distances represent ∼7\% and {\textbackslash}textgreater150\% of the length of the 3rd-order reach. Our results suggest that readily labile DOC is an important energy source at the reach scale, whereas intermediately labile DOC serves as an energy subsidy from upstream to downstream reaches. © by The North American Benthological Society.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence demonstrates the importance of in-stream processing in regulating nutrient export, yet the influence of temporal variability in stream metabolism on net nutrient uptake has not been explicitly addressed. Stream water DIN and SRP concentrations in Walker Branch, a first-order deciduous forest stream in eastern Tennessee, show a repeated pattern of annual maxima in summer and biannual minima in spring and autumn. Temporal variations in catchment hydrologic flow paths result in lower winter and higher summer nutrient concentrations, but do not explain the spring and autumn nutrient minima. Ambient nutrient uptake rates were measured 2-3 times per week over an 18-month period and compared to daily rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) to examine the influence of in-stream biotic activity on nutrient export. GPP and ER rates explained 81\% of the variation in net DIN retention with high net NO3- uptake ( and lower net NH4+ release) rates occurring during spring and autumn and net DIN release in summer. Diel nutrient concentration patterns were examined several times throughout the year to determine the relative importance of autotrophic and heterotrophic activity on net nutrient uptake. High spring GPP corresponded to daily decreases in NO3- over the illuminated hours resulting in high diel NO3- amplitude which dampened as the canopy closed. GPP explained 91\% of the variance in diel NO3- amplitude. In contrast, the autumn nutrient minima was largely explained by heterotrophic respiration since GPP remained low and little diel NO3- variation was observed during the autumn.},

	abstract = {Stream ecosystem metabolism contributes to global carbon cycling, yet predicting metabolism across ecosystems remains elusive. Even within stream segments, spatial variation in metabolic rates and their controls can be substantial, exhibiting sudden rather than continuous changes. We measured metabolism at 6 sites along a 75-km mainstem segment of Marsh Creek, Idaho. This agricultural stream lacks major geomorphic transitions such as tributaries or changes in valley width, but possesses patchy patterns of turbidity. We asked: (1) How variable is metabolism along this segment, and (2) How do the controls on metabolism vary along this segment? Metabolism varied several-fold along this stream segment. Average rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem production (NEP) among sites did not correlate with water quality or aquatic macrophyte cover. Rather, reaches along this segment appear to represent different process domains that were characterized by turbidity: More turbid reaches saw negative effects of turbidity on GPP and NEP and positive effects on ER. Turbidity was associated with increased respiration and decoupled ER from GPP at turbid sites. Less turbid sites had stronger coupling between GPP and ER, and GPP was predicted by light and temperature. Heterogeneous sediment supply and transport capacity along Marsh Creek create patchy patterns of turbidity, which affects the controls on metabolism. Geomorphic controls on ecosystem processes are complex but not random. Understanding how metabolism and its controls vary across process domains is needed to scale up process rates and understand how process rates might respond to future changes.},

 abstract = {Floodplains of large alluvial rivers are often expansive and characterized by high volume hyporheic flow through lattice-like substrata, probably formed by glacial outwash or lateral migration of the river channel over long time periods. River water downwells into the floodplain at the upstream end; and, depending on bedrock geomorphology and other factors, groundwater from the unconfined aquifer upwells directly into the channel or into floodplain springbrooks at rates determined by head pressure of the water mass moving through the floodplain hydrologic system. These large scale (km3) hyporheic zones contain speciose food webs, including specialized insects with hypogean and epigean life history stages (amphibionts) and obligate groundwater species (stygobionts). Biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone may naturally load groundwaters with bioavailable solutes that appear to exert proximal controls on production and biodiversity of surface benthos and riparian vegetation. The effect is especially evident in floodplain springbrooks. Dynamic convergence of aquifer-riverine components adds physical heterogeneity and functional complexity to floodplain landscapes. Because reaches of aggraded alluvium and attendant ecotonal processes occur serially, like beads on a string, along the river continuum, we propose the concept of a hyporheic corridor in alluvial rivers. We expect predictable zonation of groundwater communities and other aquifer-riverine convergence properties within the corridor from headwaters to river mouth. The landscape-level significance and connectivity of processes along the hyporheic corridor must be better understood if river ecosystems, especially those involving large floodplain components, are to be protected and/or rehabilitated.},

@article{jankowskiLandUseChange2021,
	abstract = {Intensive agriculture alters headwater streams, but our understanding of its effects is limited in tropical regions where rates of agricultural expansion and intensification are currently greatest. Riparian forest protections are an important conservation tool, but whether they provide adequate protection of stream function in these areas of rapid tropical agricultural development has not been well studied. To address these gaps, we conducted a study in the lowland Brazilian Amazon, an area undergoing rapid cropland expansion, to assess the effects of land use change on organic matter dynamics (OM), ecosystem metabolism, and nutrient concentrations and uptake (nitrate and phosphate) in 11 first order streams draining forested (n = 4) or cropland (n = 7) watersheds with intact riparian forests. We found that streams had similar terrestrial litter inputs, but OM biomass was lower in cropland streams. Gross primary productivity was low and not different between land uses, but ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem production showed greater seasonality in cropland streams. Although we found no difference in stream concentrations of dissolved nutrients, phosphate uptake exceeded nitrate uptake in all streams and was higher in cropland than forested streams. This indicates that streams will be more retentive of phosphorus than nitrogen and that if fertilizer nitrogen reaches streams, it will be exported in stream networks. Overall, we found relatively subtle differences in stream function, indicating that riparian buffers have thus far provided protection against major functional shifts seen in other systems. However, the changes we did observe were linked to watershed scale shifts in hydrology, water temperature, and light availability resulting from watershed deforestation. This has implications for the conservation of tens of thousands of stream kilometers across the expanding Amazon cropland region.},

	abstract = {The hyporheic zone is assumed to be an important site for decomposition and nutrient turnover in many river ecosystems. We determined ecosystem respiration, hyporheic community respiration, and respiration of the epilithic community at the sediment surface in the Necker, a gravel-bed river, during August 1994. Ecosystem respiration, assessed using single-station diel oxygen curves, varied between 4.6 and 7.0 g \${\textbackslash}backslashtext\{O\}\_\{2\}{\textbackslash}backslash {\textbackslash}backslashtext\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textbackslash}backslash {\textbackslash}backslashtext\{d\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. To estimate the respiration of the epilithic community, stones were collected from the surface layer and enclosed in flow-through respiration chambers. The respiration of the epilithic community (mainly algae) ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 g \${\textbackslash}backslashtext\{O\}\_\{2\}{\textbackslash}backslash {\textbackslash}backslashtext\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textbackslash}backslash {\textbackslash}backslashtext\{d\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, contributing 4-19\% of the river ecosystem respiration. Two different methods were used for measuring hyporheic community respiration. First, chambers were incubated at 30 cm sediment depth for direct assessment of respiration rates. Respiration rates of the hyporheic sediment were measured using a closed chamber system and extrapolated for comparison over 0.5 m and 1 m sediment depth. Second, the difference between whole-ecosystem respiration and respiration of the epilithic community was used for calculating the hyporheic contribution. Hyporheic respiration rates ranged from 3.9 to 5.9 g \${\textbackslash}backslashtext\{O\}\_\{-2\}{\textbackslash}backslash {\textbackslash}backslashtext\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}backslash {\textbackslash}backslashtext\{d\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, contributing 76-96\% of ecosystem respiration.},

@article{boix-fayosSedimentFlowPaths2015,
	abstract = {Abstract. Terrestrial sedimentation buries large amounts of organic carbon (OC) annually, contributing to the terrestrial carbon sink. The temporal significance of this sink will strongly depend on the attributes of the depositional environment, but also on the characteristics of the OC reaching these sites and its stability upon deposition. The goal of this study was to characterise the OC during transport and stored in the depositional settings of a medium-sized catchment (111 km2) in SE Spain, to better understand how soil erosion and sediment transport processes determine catchment-scale OC redistribution. Total organic carbon (TOC), mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), total nitrogen (N) and particle size distributions were determined for soils (i), suspended sediments (ii) and sediments stored in a variety of sinks such as sediment wedges behind check dams (iii), channel bars (iv), a small delta in the conjunction of the channel and a reservoir downstream (v), and the reservoir at the outlet of the catchment (vi). The data show that the OC content of sediments was approximately half of that in soils (9.42 $\pm$ 9.01 g kg−1 versus 20.45 $\pm$ 7.71 g kg−1, respectively) with important variation between sediment deposits. Selectivity of mineral and organic material during transport and deposition increased in a downstream direction. The mineralisation, burial or in situ incorporation of OC in deposited sediments depended on their transport processes and on their post-sedimentary conditions. Upstream sediments (alluvial wedges) showed low OC contents because they were partially mobilised by non-selective erosion processes affecting deeper soil layers and with low selectivity of grain sizes (e.g. gully and bank erosion). We hypothesise that the relatively short transport distances, the effective preservation of OC in microaggregates and the burial of sediments in the alluvial wedges gave rise to low OC mineralisation, as is arguably indicated by C : N ratios similar to those in soils. Deposits in middle stream areas (fluvial bars) were enriched in sand, selected upon deposition and had low OC concentrations. Downstream, sediment transported over longer distances was more selected, poorly microaggregated, and with a prevalence of silt and clay fractions and MOC pool. Overall, the study shows that OC redistribution in the studied catchment is highly complex, and that the results obtained at finer scales cannot be extrapolated at catchment scale. Selectivity of particles during detachment and transport, and protection of OC during transport and deposition are key for the concentration and quality of OC found at different depositional settings. Hence, eco-geomorphological processes during the different phases of the erosion cycle have important consequences for the temporal stability and preservation of the buried OC and in turn for the OC budget.},

During the investigation, 32 bed-moving spates (peak discharge {\textbackslash}textgreater28 m{\textbackslash}textlesssup{\textbackslash}textgreater3{\textbackslash}textless/sup{\textbackslash}textgreater/s) occurred. Bed-moving spates distinctly depressed primary production and ecosystem respiration. Spates shifted ecosystem metabolism toward heterotrophy (decreased P/R) because gross primary production was more affected than ecosystem respiration. Recovery rates of gross primary production were high in summer and low in winter. Recovery of ecosystem respiration showed less distinct seasonal variation. Energy flow through the system was calculated as the sum of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. Upper (maximum energy flow) and lower (resistant energy flow) boundaries were estimated, within which energy flow varied. The ratio of maximum to resistant energy flow, which ranged from 6.1 to 9.6, indicated that resistance to spates was small, at least after extended periods free of spates (5-8 wk).},

@article{griffithsAgriculturalLandUse2013,
	abstract = {We present a comprehensive data set of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) in open-canopy, nutrient-rich streams draining row-crop agriculture in the midwestern United States. We used two approaches to characterize temporal and spatial variation in whole-stream metabolism: continuous measurements in one agricultural stream for 1 yr, and periodic daily measurements in six agricultural streams on six dates spanning summer, autumn, and winter. Continuous measurements revealed high rates of GPP (range: 0.1 to 22.0 g O2 m22 d21) and ER (range: 20.9 to 234.8 g O2 m22 d21) that varied seasonally with light availability and temperature. GPP and ER were correlated during periods of high autotrophic production, suggesting that autotrophic respiration comprised a large portion of ER; however, the GPP:ER ratio exceeded 1 for only 4\% of the year. While there were distinct temporal patterns in metabolism in one agricultural stream, rates of GPP and ER were similar among six streams when assessed via periodic daily measurements, and 26\% of all periodic daily measurements were autotrophic with GPP:ER. 1. However, these periodic measurements were collected under baseflow conditions and may have overestimated the extent of autotrophy in agricultural streams. Overall, the open canopy and elevated nutrients of agricultural streams resulted in higher rates of GPP and ER compared with more pristine systems. Estimates of metabolism are needed from underrepresented systems to accurately quantify carbon fluxes from fluvial ecosystems. {\copyright} 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

Online access to this data is organized around the categories surface water, groundwater, water quality, and water use.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n\textbackslash r\textbackslash nSurface-water data includes more than 850,000 station years of time-series data that describe stream levels, streamflow (discharge), reservoir and lake levels, surface-water quality, and rainfall. The data are collected by automatic recorders and manual field measurements at installations across the Nation.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n\textbackslash r\textbackslash nGroundwater data consists of more than 850,000 records of wells, springs, test holes, tunnels,drains, and excavations in the United States. Available site descriptive information includes well location information such as latitude and longitude, well depth, and aquifer. The USGS annually monitors groundwater levels in thousands of wells in the United States. Groundwater level data are collected and stored as either discrete field-water-level measurements or as continuous time-series data from automated recorders. \textbackslash r\textbackslash n\textbackslash r\textbackslash nWater-quality data includes chemical, physical, and biological properties of water, sediment and tissue samples from across the Nation. The discrete sample data base is a compilation of over 4.4 million historical water quality analyses in the USGS district data bases through September 2005. At selected surface-water and groundwater sites, the USGS maintains instruments that continuously record physical and chemical characteristics of the water including pH, specific conductance, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and percent dissolved-oxygen saturation. Supporting data such as air temperature and barometric pressure are also available at some sites. At sites where this information is transmitted automatically, data are available from the current data system.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n\textbackslash r\textbackslash nWater use refers to water that is used for specific purposes. Water-use data is collected by area type (State, county, watershed or aquifer) and source such as rivers or groundwater, and category such as public supply or irrigation.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The term flashiness reflects the frequency and rapidity of short term changes in streamflow, especially during runoff events. Flashiness is an important component of a stream's hydrologic regime. A variety of land use and land management changes may lead to increased or decreased flashiness, often to the detriment of aquatic life. This paper presents a newly developed flashiness index, which is based on mean daily flows. The index is calculated by dividing the pathlength of flow oscillations for a time interval (i.e., the sum of the absolute values of day-to-day changes in mean daily flow) by total discharge during that time interval. This index has low interannual variability, relative to most flow regime indicators, and thus greater power to detect trends. Index values were calculated for 515 Midwestern streams for the 27-year period from 1975 through 2001. Statistically significant increases were present in 22 percent of the streams, primarily in the eastern portion of the study area, while decreases were present in 9 percent, primarily in the western portion. Index values tend to decrease with increasing watershed area and with increasing unit area ground water inputs. Area compensated index values often shift at ecoregion boundaries. Potential index applications include evaluation of programs to restore more natural flow regimes.},

Here, we describe the role of inland waters as sentinels and integrators of the impact of humans on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The metabolic responses of lakes and streams (ie the rates at which these systems process carbon) are proposed as a common metric to integrate the impacts of environmental change across a broad range of landscapes. Lakes and streams transport and alter nutrients, contaminants, and energy, and store signals of environmental change from local to continental scales over periods ranging from weeks to millennia. A carefully conceived and well-integrated network that includes monitoring and experimental approaches to terrestrial-aquatic connectivity is critical to an understanding of basic ecosystem-level processes and to forecasting and mitigating future environmental impacts at the continental scale. \textcopyright{} The Ecological Society of America.},
